# Phase 3 - terminal UI based on bubbletea

Using https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea and it's examples (https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/tree/main/examples) as a base:

- Implement terminal UI to fuzzy search all dependencies found in project
- Allow user to select dependency to view docs
- Allow user to use keyboard chords to add/remove dependency to/from favorites list
- Allow user to use keyboard chord to remove dependency from history list
- Implement favorites list view (same layout) to quickly access frequently used dependencies
- Implement history list view (same layout) to quickly access recently viewed dependencies
